## **Emulation of the elevator working**

The building consists of randomly generated amounts of floors (in the range 5 <= n <= 20).  
Each floor already has gotten randomly generated amount of passengers (in the range 0 <= n <= 10).  
Maximum passengers on the floor can not exceed 10.  
Maximum passengers in the elevator can not exceed 5.  
While the elevator moving up/down, it picks up the passengers on each floor, who need to go in the same direction as the elevator  

The limits and ranges can be configured in the [configure.properties](https://github.com/AlekseyEfimenko/Elevator/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.properties) file
